Icons are missing as I don't own them... the ones which fit nicely for me, I rip out from `C:\Windows\System32\DDORes.dll` with use of [NirSoft IconsExtract](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html), but you can bring any that fit your taste.

Put them under `icons` dir and name them same as output name (which can be set individually from under windows audio settings). For example:

- dac.ico
- default.ico
- headphones.ico
- headset.ico
- screen.ico
- speakers.ico

This abomination is based on:

- switching of output, on [this thread](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=49980)... at least to some extent...
- `tooltip.ahk`: Credits to engunneer [under this thread](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/21510-toaster-popups/#entry140824)

All other stuff made by me is Public Domain or WFLPL 2 if that suites you more, but you have to sort it out by yourself which part is which.
